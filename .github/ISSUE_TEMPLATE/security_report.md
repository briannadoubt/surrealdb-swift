## ⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE

**DO NOT report actual security vulnerabilities using public issues!**

   - Go to: https://github.com/briannadoubt/surrealdb-swift/security/advisories
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"

2. **Private Disclosure**: Security vulnerabilities should NEVER be disclosed publicly until a fix is available.

3. **See SECURITY.md** for full details: [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)
